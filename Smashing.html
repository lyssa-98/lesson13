	<h1>The wine</h1>
	
	<p>The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o&rsquo;clock was striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time.</p>
	
	<blockquote><p>Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment.</p></blockquote>
	
	<p>&ldquo;The rascal is off, after all!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Two thousand pounds sacrificed! He&rsquo;s as prodigal <a href="location.html">as a thief</a>! I&rsquo;ll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted.&rdquo;</p>

	<h2>What a view</h2>
	
	<p>Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the Sons of the Sun. He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama. He found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses having low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he caught &hellip;</p>
